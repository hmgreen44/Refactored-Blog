                            <p>I have always had a passion for technology. While working in sales I knew there was something more that I wanted to do with my career. Being able to participate in the Bootcamp with Awesome Inc. has allowed me to grow and find what I am truly passionate about. I look forward to continue learning and growing as a developer after the Bootcamp, and am proud to have subscribed to a lifetime of learning! </p>
